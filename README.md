# Mobile Kotlin multiplatform project template

A sample project that helps to start building a Mobile Kotlin Multiplatform application. It establishes an architecture optimized for building cross-platform mobile applications through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.

## Features

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**'s motto is *Don't Repeat Yourself*. Share the business logic code written in Kotlin between Android and iOS apps. 100% native UI and performance (shared code compiles into native libraries);
- **Kotlin Gradle DSL** – Configure project with flexible Kotlin Gradle DSL;
- **Modular-bazed architecture** – Implement app features independently of each other. Inject dependencies into features at compile-time through the use of the `Factory` class;
- **Parallel build of modules** – Feature modules and the `domain` module don't depend on each other. This provides caching of build artifacts for each module and results in better compilation time;
- **Dependencies definition in buildSrc** - Simplify dependency management across modules;
- **Ready to use** - Template project includes all [moko libraries](https://moko.icerock.dev) and supports most common use cases:
  - ViewModels;
  - LiveData;
  - Resource management;
  - Runtime permissions access;
  - Media access;
  - UI lists management from shared code;
  - Network layer generation from OpenAPI.

## Modules
### Legend
The color describes different modules and the shape - the type of an element (class|interface).

### Modules scheme
![modules scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5010169/67163239-30629100-f375-11e9-9b10-fbcc3d3ea0bb.jpg)
This scheme shows the structure of the project:  

- We have two applications that represent the View application layer:
  - `android-app` written in Kotlin uses `Activity` and `Fragment`;
  - `ios-app` written in Swift uses `UIViewController` with Storyboards.
- Both applications depend on `mpp-library` (Kotlin Multiplatform) that provides access to `ViewModel`'s of each feature through `SharedFactory`. The library is responsible for setting up connections between the `feature` and `domain` modules.
- `mpp-library` consists of modules:
  - `domain` (Kotlin Multiplatform) - contains the domain entities, repositories, server API classes, and `DomainFactory` that creates instances for all of them;
  - `feature` (Kotlin Multiplatform). Every feature contains corresponding ViewModel, Factory, models, and interfaces it expects to be injected from the parent module. In this example:
    - `config` contains an config feature's ViewModel, data store interface and `ConfigFactory` that create instances of ViewModel;
    - `list` contains a items list feature's ViewModel, data source interface, list items factory interface, and `ListFactory` that create instances of ViewModel.

### Config module scheme

The connections between the `feature:config` classes and the `domain` classes implemented in the `mpp-library` module.

### List module scheme
![list module scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5010169/67163236-2e003700-f375-11e9-8c79-1b9ec96db26b.jpg)
The connections between the `feature:list` classes and the `domain` classes implemented in the `mpp-library` module.  
`SharedFactory.NewsUnitsFactory` interface is implemented on both platforms - Android (`android-app`) and iOS (`ios-app`).

## How to Run

Android - just open repository root directory in Android Studio and press `Run`.  
iOS - run `pod install` in directory `ios-app`. Then open `ios-app/ios-app.xcworkspace` and press `Run` on simulator/device.

## Project setup

### Setup your own ApplicationId

*Just like in other native apps*  
In `android-app/build.gradle.kts` change `org.example.app` in the following line:
```kotlin
applicationId = "org.example.app"
```
In Xcode project settings change `Bundle Identifier`.

### Setup your own project name

*Just like in other native apps*  
In `android-app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` change value of `app_name`.  
In Xcode project settings change `Display name`.

### Setup your own app icon

*Just like in other native apps*  
Put your android icon to `android-app/src/main/res` and setup usage in `android-app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.  
Put your iOS icon to `ios-app/src/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`.

### Create new feature module

Create a file `mpp-library/feature/myfeature/build.gradle.kts` with the following content:
```kotlin
plugins {
    plugin(Deps.Plugins.androidLibrary)
    plugin(Deps.Plugins.kotlinMultiplatform)
    plugin(Deps.Plugins.mobileMultiplatform)
}
```
Add module to `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Deps.kt`:
```kotlin
object Deps {
    ...

    object Modules {
        ...

        object Feature {
            ...

            val myfeature = MultiPlatformModule(
                name = ":mpp-library:feature:myfeature",
                exported = true
            )
        }
    }
}
```
Add module to `settings.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
include(":mpp-library:feature:myfeature")
```
Add dependency to module from the `mpp-library` in `mpp-library/build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
val mppModules = listOf(
    ...
    Modules.MultiPlatform.Feature.myfeature
)
```
